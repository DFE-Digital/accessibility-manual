Keep your content and website consistent. It makes it easier for people with memory issues, learning disabilities, or attention impairments to find what they need quickly.</p>

  Only ask users for information you need when designing a form. If an error occurs, explain what went wrong, and how to resolve it. 
</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
 Some people find it difficult to be precise when they enter information which can cause errors. Users should be able to resolve errors, undo mistakes and easily understand where they went wrong.

                <p class="govuk-body">
 Users do not want to be distracted. This can be especially problematic for people with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Animations, banners and adverts can be extremely distracting for many people.

 Users can often lose focus or be distracted during tasks. Emails, messages and colleagues in the office can all be distractors. It's important that users can reorient themselves if they do become distracted or have to switch tasks during a process.

&lt;p class=&quot;govuk-body&quot;&gt;The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies
    (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the 'accessibility regulations'). If you're
    not happy with how we respond to your complaint, &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/&quot;
        target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (opens in a new tab)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;govuk-heading-l&quot;&gt;Technical information about this website's accessibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;govuk-body&quot;&gt;The Department for Education is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public
    Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;govuk-heading-l&quot;&gt;Compliance status&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;govuk-body&quot;&gt;This website is partially compliant with the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) version 2.2 AA
    standard, due to the following non-compliances (and/or) the following exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Non-accessible content&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;govuk-body&quot;&gt;The content is non-accessible for the following reason(s):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;govuk-list&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;[Some images don't contain alternative text to describe the image which does not meet &lt;a
            href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;
            rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;WCAG version 2.2 AA - 1.1.1 Non-text Content&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Disproportionate burden&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;govuk-body&quot;&gt;We have determined that there is disproportionate burden to meet all the requirements for the
    following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;govuk-list&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;[Making improvements would exceed budget for the year and leave the department unable to do other work -
        and would not significantly improve things for disabled users.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The content is not within the scope of the accessibility regulations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;govuk-list&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;[PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018 are out of scope of the regulations.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

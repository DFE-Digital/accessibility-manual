        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="who-should-test-with-a-screen-reader">Who should test with a screen reader</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Everyone can test with a screen reader. It's useful to understand how people who use one might navigate a service you're creating, content you're writing, or a document you're drafting.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Interaction designers and developers especially, should know the basics of a screen reader and be able to carry out checks on a service they're designing or developing.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="how-to-start-testing-with-a-screen-reader">How to start testing with a screen reader</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Most screen readers are used in the same way, but they all have their own keyboard shortcuts and commands.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The easier way to start testing with one is to switch the screen reader on and use the tab key to navigate through your service. This will give a basic idea of how a screen reader works and the type of information that is relayed audibly to a user.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">However, this will only give you information on interactive components, such as links and buttons in your service. There are many other types of web content that should be tested to ensure your website is accessible.</p>

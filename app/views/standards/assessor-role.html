                <p class="govuk-body">As a government department, we need to make sure that our products and websites are accessible. We also need to make sure that our products and websites are compliant with accessibility regulations.</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">Although user research and design assessors can review how accessible a product or website is, it's not their main professional area of expertise. This is why weâ€™ve introduced the role of the accessibility specialist to the assessment panel.</p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="what-the-role-does">What the role does</h2>

                <p class="govuk-body">The accessibility specialist works alongside the rest of the assessor panel with a specific focus on accessibility and inclusive design at alpha, beta and live phases.</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">Due to the low number of accessibility specialists, there will not always be an assessor on every panel.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Accessibility specialists will assess large or complex products or websites.</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">The accessibility specialist will take an in-depth look at all aspects of accessibility and inclusive design.</p>

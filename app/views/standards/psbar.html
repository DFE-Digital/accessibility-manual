                <p class="govuk-body">The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/contents/made" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">Accessibility Regulations 2018</a> are accessibility standards for public sector websites and mobile apps which help to ensure they can be used by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities.</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">This law, often abbreviated to PSBAR, requires public bodies to specifically meet the latest published version of <a href="/wcag-explorer" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">WCAG</a>.</p>

                <div class="govuk-inset-text">
[Kerry and Jake] - Can we work on a plain english explaination of this law and that its implemented through our standard and in essence what someone must do. CoPilot suggests the following:
                    </div>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">The PSBAR 2018 regulations</h2>
                <p class="govuk-body">They are UK-wide rules telling public sector organisations how to make their websites and mobile apps accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">In simple terms, “accessible” means that anyone—regardless of vision, hearing, mobility or cognitive ability—can use online services without undue difficulty.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">These regulations came into force on 23 September 2018 for new and existing websites, and from 23 June 2021 for mobile applications.</p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Why it matters for DfE</h2>
                <p class="govuk-body">As a government department, the DfE must follow these rules. If you create or update a website or app, it must meet the accessibility requirements.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Accessible design isn’t just a legal box-tick. It ensures parents, teachers, students and other stakeholders can use our online services without barriers.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Following PSBAR 2018 also improves overall user experience, reduces support calls (e.g. fewer “I can’t read that” enquiries) and demonstrates inclusivity.</p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Who this applies to</h2>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>all public sector bodies: central government departments (like DfE), local authorities, schools, NHS trusts, etc.</li>
                    <li>all new websites published after 23 September 2018 must be accessible from day one</li>
                    <li>existing websites (“legacy” sites) had to comply by 23 September 2020</li>
                    <li>new mobile apps published after 23 June 2021 must be accessible from launch</li>
                    <li>existing mobile apps must comply by 23 June 2021 (although in practice that grace period has already passed)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What “accessible” means</h2>
                <p class="govuk-body">In practice, it means:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>
    following recognised standards (WCAG 2.2 AA)
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                            <li>the regulations refer to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 at <a href="/wcag-explorer/conformance" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">level AA</a></li>
                            <li>WCAG 2.2 AA covers things like providing text alternatives for images, ensuring sufficient colour contrast, enabling keyboard navigation, labelling form fields correctly, avoiding content that flashes, and so on</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
    publishing an accessibility statement
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                            <li>how accessible the site/app is (i.e. which WCAG criteria are met)</li>
                            <li>any known issues (for example, if a document isn’t in an accessible format)</li>
                            <li>a date for when the statement was last reviewed</li>
                            <li>how users can report accessibility problems (e.g. an email address or online form)</li>
                            <li>the name and contact details of the person or team responsible for the statement</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
    providing a feedback/escalation path
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                            <li>users must be able to report any accessibility barriers fairly easily (typically via a dedicated email or online form)</li>
                            <li>the DfE then needs to respond to those reports within a reasonable timeframe, either offering a workaround or fixing the issue</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
    regular monitoring and review
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                            <li>accessibility isn’t a one-off task. you must regularly check (e.g. every 6–12 months) that both websites and apps still comply with WCAG 2.2 AA</li>
                            <li>any new features, pages or documents added to the site must also be checked before they go live</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Content in scope</h2>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>all public-facing web pages on DfE websites. that includes pages for policy, guidance, news, events, etc</li>
                    <li>all PDFs, Word files or other downloadable documents that were added after 23 September 2018 (existing legacy documents were supposed to be made accessible by 23 September 2020, but you should aim to ensure all important docs are accessible even if published earlier)</li>
                    <li>mobile applications published or updated after 23 June 2021—whether that’s an iOS or Android DfE app</li>
                    <li>in-situ online services such as e-forms, online assessments or feedback tools. any interactive feature needs to be accessible</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Content out of scope</h2>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>pre-recorded video or audio (though if you publish pre-recorded content you should aim to provide captions or transcripts voluntarily—we strongly recommend it even if not strictly enforced)</li>
                    <li>third-party content not under your control (e.g. embedded YouTube videos). however, you should encourage the third party to comply or find an alternative if accessibility is not adequate</li>
                    <li>PDFs or documents published before 23 September 2018, provided they have not been “substantially updated” since then. that said, best practice is to make all documents accessible as soon as possible</li>
                </ul>
